MANIFESTO FOR ACCOUNTING

The current financial reporting system combines transaction verification with valuation interpretation. Although this combination has developed historically, it creates a structural tension between legal reality and accounting representation.

When wages are paid, the employee acquires a bank balance. Legally, this does not constitute ownership of specific money, but rather a claim on the credit institution. In practice, however, this balance is treated in personal accounting or asset representation as an asset without explicit reference to the underlying credit relationship.

This discrepancy is not an error in double-entry bookkeeping, but points to an information asymmetry: the legal nature of the bank balance (claim) and its economic perception (available assets) do not fully coincide.

As a result, solvency and coverage of balances can only be assessed indirectly via the financial institution's general balance sheet. There is no structural link between individual balances and an explicit, externally verifiable coverage ratio.

In the current system, market valuations of financial institutions are partly determined by expectations regarding future cash flows and risk management. These valuations depend on interpretative assumptions (e.g., credit quality, liquidity management, and risk models). The gap between legal debt structure and economic valuation creates a space in which perception and trust play a central role.

“Officially reported inflation is an accounting fiction that conceals the fact that every form of economic yield — from wages to profits — is hijacked by banks as collateral for liabilities, thereby diluting the real value of money creation through the unauthorized creation of debt.”

Current banking practice is based on the false assumption that citizens consent to the expropriation of their wage mass. However, according to Art. 5.65 of the Civil Code, when interpreting contracts, the actual common intention of the parties must be ascertained, rather than adhering to the literal meaning of the words.

No employee or company intends, when opening a wage account, to transfer their title of ownership to a private institution to serve as speculative working capital. The real will of the citizen is safekeeping and immediate disposal, not the provision of an unsecured loan to a bank. 

The literal terms and conditions of the bank are intrinsically incompatible with this.
